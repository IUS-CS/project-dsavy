 ## Jason Henry
 Overall, I got a lot out of this project and course. Before C346 I didn't have much experience with git and github; doing this project as a group made learning the git workflow a must which has made me more confident in using git. I also had never done any front-end stuff so learning how to create a dynamic UI was challenging but rewarding. I do wish I put more time in learning the react-spring library to make the animations I did more creative and cool, but overall I am happy with my work. After this project I have a better idea of why software architecture and design patterns are important, before I never thought about any of that but now I see why they are important to the overall design and structure of the software. After C346 I have a new motivation to put more projects on github, learn how to write better testable code, and learn how to incorporate design patterns in my code. I would say testing was my biggest struggle, testing a UI is a lot harder than it seemed. 
 
Throughout this project I helped with implementing data structure and algorithm components and testing; the two components I focused on were the Queue and Insertion Sort. The queue was fairly easy to implement but the insertion sort was another story. The way React handles state and changes in state brought some trouble when trying to show each swap of the algorithm. But Zaid was able to figure out a way to make state changes and have them render right away, which allowed me to use the same method in the insertion sort. Working with the group went really well and my partners were a big help along the way which was awesome.
