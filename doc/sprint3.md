  ## Retro
  
  ### Good
  
  * Group communicated tasks efficiently 
  * Linked List has animation
  * Queue has animation 
  * Stack has animation 
  * Testing is getting better 
  
  ### Bad
  
  * Testing needs to be done as features are added instead of after 
  * GUI needs to be uniform across all features 
  
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * Testing needs to be improved 
  * As a team, we will continue to think of which data structures and algorithms to incorporate
  * As a team, we will improve the functionality of existing components 
  
  ## Planning
