# Project Vision
DSAVY is for students or anyone who is wanting to learn basic data structures and algorithms. 
DSAVY is a web application that will aid in the learning process by providing visualization of data structures and algorithms to manipulate the structures such as insertion, deletion, and sorting. 
Unlike other resources that aid in the learning of data structures, our project is specifically targeted towards beginners so users will not feel overwhelmed when first starting to learn data structures and algorithms. 

# Why DSAVY?
DSAVY will have a simple user interface for different data structures so users can visually see what is happening when carrying out a specific operation on the data structure. 
Each structure will have pseudocode on the same page that the visualization is happening so the user can follow it while carrying out the operations on the data structure. 
This combination of pseudocode and visualization will aid the user in implementing a data structure themselves in the language of their choice. 

Since DSAVY is specifically geared towards students and beginners, it will include basic data structures such as singly linked list, queues, stacks, binary trees, and sorting algorithms.
Users will be able to use their own values when manipulating the data structures so they can see the structure being manipulated in real-time and by their own standards. 
When first starting to learn these concepts it is easy to get confused about how different structures store and manipulate data, DSAVY will help students learn the basics to build a solid foundation.
