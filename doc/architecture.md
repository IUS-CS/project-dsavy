## Introduction

DSAVY's purpose is to provide animation to operations on data structures, such as adding and removing, and certain algorithms like sorting. The user supplys the data for the structure or algorithm to work with. This is so users can see the animation of specific events they want to happen when maniuplating the given components.  


## Architectural Representation

* Data Structure/Algorithm component
  * Operation component(s)
  * Input component(s)
  * Display component(s)
  * Animation component(s)
